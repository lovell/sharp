The typical use case for this high speed Node.js module
is to convert large images in common formats to
smaller, web-friendly JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF and AVIF images of varying dimensions.

Resizing an image is typically 4x-5x faster than using the
quickest ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick settings
due to its use of [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips).

Colour spaces, embedded ICC profiles and alpha transparency channels are all handled correctly.
Lanczos resampling ensures quality is not sacrificed for speed.

As well as image resizing, operations such as
rotation, extraction, compositing and gamma correction are available.

Most modern macOS, Windows and Linux systems running Node.js >= 14.15.0
do not require any additional install or runtime dependencies.

## Examples

```sh
npm install sharp
```

```javascript
const sharp = require('sharp');
```

### Callback

```javascript
sharp(inputBuffer)
  .resize(320, 240)
  .toFile('output.webp', (err, info) => { ... });
```

### Promise

```javascript
sharp('input.jpg')
  .rotate()
  .resize(200)
  .jpeg({ mozjpeg: true })
  .toBuffer()
  .then( data => { ... })
  .catch( err => { ... });
```

### Async/await

```javascript
const semiTransparentRedPng = await sharp({
  create: {
    width: 48,
    height: 48,
    channels: 4,
    background: { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, alpha: 0.5 }
  }
})
  .png()
  .toBuffer();
```

### Stream

```javascript
const roundedCorners = Buffer.from(
  '<svg><rect x="0" y="0" width="200" height="200" rx="50" ry="50"/></svg>'
);

const roundedCornerResizer =
  sharp()
    .resize(200, 200)
    .composite([{
      input: roundedCorners,
      blend: 'dest-in'
    }])
    .png();

readableStream
  .pipe(roundedCornerResizer)
  .pipe(writableStream);
```

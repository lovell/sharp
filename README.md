# sharp

```sh
npm install sharp
```

The typical use case for this high speed Node.js module
is to convert large images in common formats to
smaller, web-friendly JPEG, PNG and WebP images of varying dimensions.

Resizing an image is typically 4x-5x faster than using the
quickest ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick settings.

Colour spaces, embedded ICC profiles and alpha transparency channels are all handled correctly.
Lanczos resampling ensures quality is not sacrificed for speed.

As well as image resizing, operations such as
rotation, extraction, compositing and gamma correction are available.

OS X, Windows (x64), Linux (x64, ARM) systems do not require
the installation of any external runtime dependencies.

## Examples

```javascript
import sharp from 'sharp';
```

```javascript
sharp(inputBuffer)
  .resize(320, 240)
  .toFile('output.webp', (err, info) => ... );
  // A Promises/A+ promise is returned when callback is not provided.
```



```javascript
sharp('input.jpg')
  .rotate()
  .resize(200)
  .toBuffer()
  .then( data => ... )
  .catch( err => ... );
```

```javascript
const roundedCorners = new Buffer(
  '<svg><rect x="0" y="0" width="200" height="200" rx="50" ry="50"/></svg>'
);

const roundedCornerResizer =
  sharp()
    .resize(200, 200)
    .overlayWith(roundedCorners, { cutout: true })
    .png();

readableStream
  .pipe(roundedCornerResizer)
  .pipe(writableStream);
```

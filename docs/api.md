# API

```javascript
var sharp = require('sharp');
```

### Input

#### sharp([input])

Constructor to which further methods are chained. `input`, if present, can be one of:

* Buffer containing JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF* or TIFF image data, or
* String containing the path to an image file, with most major formats supported.

The object returned implements the
[stream.Duplex](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_duplex) class.

JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF* or TIFF format image data
can be streamed into the object when `input` is not provided.

JPEG, PNG or WebP format image data can be streamed out from this object.

\* libvips 8.0.0+ is required for Buffer/Stream input of GIF and other `magick` formats.

```javascript
sharp('input.jpg')
  .resize(300, 200)
  .toFile('output.jpg', function(err) {
    // output.jpg is a 300 pixels wide and 200 pixels high image
    // containing a scaled and cropped version of input.jpg
  });
```

#### metadata([callback])

Fast access to image metadata without decoding any compressed image data.

`callback`, if present, gets the arguments `(err, metadata)` where `metadata` has the attributes:

* `format`: Name of decoder to be used to decompress image data e.g. `jpeg`, `png`, `webp` (for file-based input additionally `tiff`, `magick` and `openslide`)
* `width`: Number of pixels wide
* `height`: Number of pixels high
* `space`: Name of colour space interpretation e.g. `srgb`, `rgb`, `scrgb`, `cmyk`, `lab`, `xyz`, `b-w` [...](https://github.com/jcupitt/libvips/blob/master/libvips/iofuncs/enumtypes.c#L522)
* `channels`: Number of bands e.g. `3` for sRGB, `4` for CMYK
* `hasProfile`: Boolean indicating the presence of an embedded ICC profile
* `hasAlpha`: Boolean indicating the presence of an alpha transparency channel
* `orientation`: Number value of the EXIF Orientation header, if present
* `exif`: Buffer containing raw EXIF data, if present
* `icc`: Buffer containing raw [ICC](https://www.npmjs.com/package/icc) profile data, if present

A Promises/A+ promise is returned when `callback` is not provided.

```javascript
var image = sharp(inputJpg);
image
  .metadata()
  .then(function(metadata) {
    return image
      .resize(Math.round(metadata.width / 2))
      .webp()
      .toBuffer();
  })
  .then(function(data) {
    // data contains a WebP image half the width and height of the original JPEG
  });
```

#### clone()

Takes a "snapshot" of the instance, returning a new instance.
Cloned instances inherit the input of their parent instance.

This allows multiple output Streams
and therefore multiple processing pipelines
to share a single input Stream.

```javascript
var pipeline = sharp().rotate();
pipeline.clone().resize(800, 600).pipe(firstWritableStream);
pipeline.clone().extract(20, 20, 100, 100).pipe(secondWritableStream);
readableStream.pipe(pipeline);
// firstWritableStream receives auto-rotated, resized readableStream
// secondWritableStream receives auto-rotated, extracted region of readableStream
```

#### sequentialRead()

An advanced setting that switches the libvips access method to `VIPS_ACCESS_SEQUENTIAL`.
This will reduce memory usage and can improve performance on some systems.

#### limitInputPixels(pixels)

Do not process input images where the number of pixels (width * height) exceeds this limit.

`pixels` is the integral Number of pixels, with a value between 1 and the default 268402689 (0x3FFF * 0x3FFF).

### Resizing

#### resize([width], [height])

Scale output to `width` x `height`. By default, the resized image is cropped to the exact size specified.

`width` is the integral Number of pixels wide the resultant image should be, between 1 and 16383 (0x3FFF). Use `null` or `undefined` to auto-scale the width to match the height.

`height` is the integral Number of pixels high the resultant image should be, between 1 and 16383. Use `null` or `undefined` to auto-scale the height to match the width.

#### crop([gravity])

Crop the resized image to the exact size specified, the default behaviour.

`gravity`, if present, is a String or an attribute of the `sharp.gravity` Object e.g. `sharp.gravity.north`.

Possible values are `north`, `northeast`, `east`, `southeast`, `south`, `southwest`, `west`, `northwest`, `center` and `centre`.
The default gravity is `center`/`centre`.

```javascript
var transformer = sharp()
  .resize(300, 200)
  .crop(sharp.gravity.north)
  .on('error', function(err) {
    console.log(err);
  });
// Read image data from readableStream, resize and write image data to writableStream
readableStream.pipe(transformer).pipe(writableStream);
```

#### embed()

Preserving aspect ratio, resize the image to the
maximum `width` or `height` specified
then embed on a background of the exact
`width` and `height` specified.

If the background contains an alpha value
then WebP and PNG format output images will
contain an alpha channel,
even when the input image does not.

```javascript
sharp('input.gif')
  .resize(200, 300)
  .background({r: 0, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0})
  .embed()
  .toFormat(sharp.format.webp)
  .toBuffer(function(err, outputBuffer) {
    if (err) {
      throw err;
    }
    // outputBuffer contains WebP image data of a 200 pixels wide and 300 pixels high
    // containing a scaled version, embedded on a transparent canvas, of input.gif
  });
```

#### max()

Preserving aspect ratio,
resize the image to be as large as possible
while ensuring its dimensions are less than or equal to
the `width` and `height` specified.

Both `width` and `height` must be provided via
`resize` otherwise the behaviour will default to `crop`.

```javascript
sharp(inputBuffer)
  .resize(200, 200)
  .max()
  .toFormat('jpeg')
  .toBuffer()
  .then(function(outputBuffer) {
    // outputBuffer contains JPEG image data no wider than 200 pixels and no higher
    // than 200 pixels regardless of the inputBuffer image dimensions
  });
```

#### min()

Preserving aspect ratio,
resize the image to be as small as possible
while ensuring its dimensions are greater than or equal to
the `width` and `height` specified.

Both `width` and `height` must be provided via `resize` otherwise the behaviour will default to `crop`.

#### withoutEnlargement()

Do not enlarge the output image
if the input image width *or* height
are already less than the required dimensions.

This is equivalent to GraphicsMagick's `>` geometry option:
"*change the dimensions of the image only
if its width or height exceeds the geometry specification*".

#### ignoreAspectRatio()

Ignoring the aspect ratio of the input, stretch the image to the exact `width` and/or `height` provided via `resize`.

#### interpolateWith(interpolator)

Use the given interpolator for image resizing, where `interpolator` is an attribute of the `sharp.interpolator` Object e.g. `sharp.interpolator.bicubic`.

The default interpolator is `bicubic`, providing a general-purpose interpolator that is both fast and of good quality.

Possible interpolators, in order of performance, are:

* `nearest`: Use [nearest neighbour interpolation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest-neighbor_interpolation), suitable for image enlargement only.
* `bilinear`: Use [bilinear interpolation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation), faster than bicubic but with less smooth results.
* `vertexSplitQuadraticBasisSpline`: Use the smoother [VSQBS interpolation](https://github.com/jcupitt/libvips/blob/master/libvips/resample/vsqbs.cpp#L48) to prevent "staircasing" when enlarging.
* `bicubic`: Use [bicubic interpolation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicubic_interpolation) (the default).
* `locallyBoundedBicubic`: Use [LBB interpolation](https://github.com/jcupitt/libvips/blob/master/libvips/resample/lbb.cpp#L100), which prevents some "[acutance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acutance)" but typically reduces performance by a factor of 2.
* `nohalo`: Use [Nohalo interpolation](http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/268086/), which prevents acutance but typically reduces performance by a factor of 3.

[Compare the output of these interpolators](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/tree/master/test/interpolators)

```javascript
sharp(inputBuffer)
  .resize(200, 300)
  .interpolateWith(sharp.interpolator.nohalo)
  .background('white')
  .embed()
  .toFile('output.tiff')
  .then(function() {
    // output.tiff is a 200 pixels wide and 300 pixels high image
    // containing a nohalo scaled version, embedded on a white canvas,
    // of the image data in inputBuffer
  });
```

### Operations

#### extract(top, left, width, height)

Extract a region of the image. Can be used with or without a `resize` operation.

`top` and `left` are the offset, in pixels, from the top-left corner.

`width` and `height` are the dimensions of the extracted image.

Use `extract` before `resize` for pre-resize extraction. Use `extract` after `resize` for post-resize extraction. Use `extract` before and after for both.

```javascript
sharp(input)
  .extract(top, left, width, height)
  .toFile(output, function(err) {
    // Extract a region of the input image, saving in the same format.
  });
```

```javascript
sharp(input)
  .extract(topOffsetPre, leftOffsetPre, widthPre, heightPre)
  .resize(width, height)
  .extract(topOffsetPost, leftOffsetPost, widthPost, heightPost)
  .toFile(output, function(err) {
    // Extract a region, resize, then extract from the resized image
  });
```

#### background(rgba)

Set the background for the `embed` and `flatten` operations.

`rgba` is parsed by the [color](https://www.npmjs.org/package/color) module to extract values for red, green, blue and alpha.

The alpha value is a float between `0` (transparent) and `1` (opaque).

The default background is `{r: 0, g: 0, b: 0, a: 1}`, black without transparency.

#### flatten()

Merge alpha transparency channel, if any, with `background`.

#### rotate([angle])

Rotate the output image by either an explicit angle or auto-orient based on the EXIF `Orientation` tag.

`angle`, if present, is a Number with a value of `0`, `90`, `180` or `270`.

Use this method without `angle` to determine the angle from EXIF data. Mirroring is supported and may infer the use of a `flip` operation.

Method order is important when both rotating and extracting regions, for example `rotate(x).extract(y)` will produce a different result to `extract(y).rotate(x)`.

The use of `rotate` implies the removal of the EXIF `Orientation` tag, if any.

```javascript
var pipeline = sharp()
  .rotate()
  .resize(null, 200)
  .progressive()
  .toBuffer(function(err, outputBuffer, info) {
    if (err) {
      throw err;
    }
    // outputBuffer contains 200px high progressive JPEG image data,
    // auto-rotated using EXIF Orientation tag
    // info.width and info.height contain the dimensions of the resized image
  });
readableStream.pipe(pipeline);
```

#### flip()

Flip the image about the vertical Y axis. This always occurs after rotation, if any.
The use of `flip` implies the removal of the EXIF `Orientation` tag, if any.

#### flop()

Flop the image about the horizontal X axis. This always occurs after rotation, if any.
The use of `flop` implies the removal of the EXIF `Orientation` tag, if any.

#### blur([sigma])

When used without parameters, performs a fast, mild blur of the output image. This typically reduces performance by 10%.

When a `sigma` is provided, performs a slower, more accurate Gaussian blur. This typically reduces performance by 25%.

* `sigma`, if present, is a Number between 0.3 and 1000 representing the approximate blur radius in pixels.

#### sharpen([radius], [flat], [jagged])

When used without parameters, performs a fast, mild sharpen of the output image. This typically reduces performance by 10%.

When a `radius` is provided, performs a slower, more accurate sharpen of the L channel in the LAB colour space. Separate control over the level of sharpening in "flat" and "jagged" areas is available. This typically reduces performance by 50%.

* `radius`, if present, is an integral Number representing the sharpen mask radius in pixels.
* `flat`, if present, is a Number representing the level of sharpening to apply to "flat" areas, defaulting to a value of 1.0.
* `jagged`, if present, is a Number representing the level of sharpening to apply to "jagged" areas, defaulting to a value of 2.0.

#### threshold([threshold])

Converts all pixels in the image to greyscale white or black.  Any pixel greather-than-or-equal-to the threshold (0..255) will be white.  All others will be black.

* `threshold`, if present, is a Number, representing the level above which pixels will be forced to white.

#### gamma([gamma])

Apply a gamma correction by reducing the encoding (darken) pre-resize at a factor of `1/gamma` then increasing the encoding (brighten) post-resize at a factor of `gamma`.

`gamma`, if present, is a Number between 1 and 3. The default value is `2.2`, a suitable approximation for sRGB images.

This can improve the perceived brightness of a resized image in non-linear colour spaces.

JPEG input images will not take advantage of the shrink-on-load performance optimisation when applying a gamma correction.

#### grayscale() / greyscale()

Convert to 8-bit greyscale; 256 shades of grey.

This is a linear operation. If the input image is in a non-linear colour space such as sRGB, use `gamma()` with `greyscale()` for the best results.

The output image will still be web-friendly sRGB and contain three (identical) channels.

#### normalize() / normalise()

Enhance output image contrast by stretching its luminance to cover the full dynamic range. This typically reduces performance by 30%.

#### overlayWith(path)

_Experimental_

Alpha composite image at `path` over the processed (resized, extracted) image. The dimensions of the two images must match.

* `path` is a String containing the path to an image file with an alpha channel.

```javascript
sharp('input.png')
  .rotate(180)
  .resize(300)
  .flatten()
  .background('#ff6600')
  .overlayWith('overlay.png')
  .sharpen()
  .withMetadata()
  .quality(90)
  .webp()
  .toBuffer()
  .then(function(outputBuffer) {
    // outputBuffer contains upside down, 300px wide, alpha channel flattened
    // onto orange background, composited with overlay.png, sharpened,
    // with metadata, 90% quality WebP image data. Phew!
  });
```

### Output

#### toFile(path, [callback])

`path` is a String containing the path to write the image data to. The format is inferred from the extension, with JPEG, PNG, WebP, TIFF and DZI supported.

`callback`, if present, is called with two arguments `(err, info)` where:

* `err` contains an error message, if any.
* `info` contains the output image `format`, `size` (bytes), `width` and `height`.

A Promises/A+ promise is returned when `callback` is not provided.

#### toBuffer([callback])

Write image data to a Buffer, the format of which will match the input image by default. JPEG, PNG and WebP are supported.

`callback`, if present, gets three arguments `(err, buffer, info)` where:

* `err` is an error message, if any.
* `buffer` is the output image data.
* `info` contains the output image `format`, `size` (bytes), `width` and `height`.

A Promises/A+ promise is returned when `callback` is not provided.

#### jpeg()

Use JPEG format for the output image.

#### png()

Use PNG format for the output image.

#### webp()

Use WebP format for the output image.

#### raw()

_Requires libvips 7.42.0+_

Provide raw, uncompressed uint8 (unsigned char) image data for Buffer and Stream based output.

The number of channels depends on the input image and selected options.

* 1 channel for images converted to `greyscale()`, with each byte representing one pixel.
* 3 channels for colour images without alpha transparency, with bytes ordered \[red, green, blue, red, green, blue, etc.\]).
* 4 channels for colour images with alpha transparency, with bytes ordered \[red, green, blue, alpha, red, green, blue, alpha, etc.\].

#### toFormat(format)

Convenience method for the above output format methods, where `format` is either:

* an attribute of the `sharp.format` Object e.g. `sharp.format.jpeg`, or
* a String containing `jpeg`, `png`, `webp` or `raw`.

#### quality(quality)

The output quality to use for lossy JPEG, WebP and TIFF output formats. The default quality is `80`.

`quality` is a Number between 1 and 100.

#### progressive()

Use progressive (interlace) scan for JPEG and PNG output. This typically reduces compression performance by 30% but results in an image that can be rendered sooner when decompressed.

#### withMetadata([metadata])

Include all metadata (EXIF, XMP, IPTC) from the input image in the output image.
This will also convert to and add the latest web-friendly v2 sRGB ICC profile.

The optional `metadata` parameter, if present, is an Object with the attributes to update.
New attributes cannot be inserted, only existing attributes updated.

* `orientation` is an integral Number between 0 and 7, used to update the value of the EXIF `Orientation` tag.
This has no effect if the input image does not have an EXIF `Orientation` tag.

The default behaviour, when `withMetadata` is not used, is to strip all metadata and convert to the device-independent sRGB colour space.

#### tile([size], [overlap])

The size and overlap, in pixels, of square Deep Zoom image pyramid tiles.

* `size` is an integral Number between 1 and 8192. The default value is 256 pixels.
* `overlap` is an integral Number between 0 and 8192. The default value is 0 pixels.

```javascript
sharp('input.tiff').tile(256).toFile('output.dzi', function(err, info) {
  // The output.dzi file is the XML format Deep Zoom definition
  // The output_files directory contains 256x256 pixel tiles grouped by zoom level
});
```

#### withoutChromaSubsampling()

Disable the use of [chroma subsampling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling) with JPEG output (4:4:4).

This can improve colour representation at higher quality settings (90+),
but usually increases output file size and typically reduces performance by 25%.

The default behaviour is to use chroma subsampling (4:2:0).

#### compressionLevel(compressionLevel)

An advanced setting for the _zlib_ compression level of the lossless PNG output format. The default level is `6`.

`compressionLevel` is a Number between 0 and 9.

#### withoutAdaptiveFiltering()

_Requires libvips 7.42.0+_

An advanced setting to disable adaptive row filtering for the lossless PNG output format.

#### trellisQuantisation() / trellisQuantization()

_Requires libvips 8.0.0+ compiled against mozjpeg 3.0+_

An advanced setting to apply the use of
[trellis quantisation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trellis_quantization) with JPEG output.
Reduces file size and slightly increases relative quality at the cost of increased compression time.

#### overshootDeringing()

_Requires libvips 8.0.0+ compiled against mozjpeg 3.0+_

An advanced setting to reduce the effects of
[ringing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringing_%28signal%29) in JPEG output,
in particular where black text appears on a white background (or vice versa).

#### optimiseScans() / optimizeScans()

_Requires libvips 8.0.0+ compiled against mozjpeg 3.0+_

An advanced setting for progressive (interlace) JPEG output.
Calculates which spectrum of DCT coefficients uses the fewest bits.
Usually reduces file size at the cost of increased compression time.

### Attributes

#### format

An Object containing nested boolean values
representing the available input and output formats/methods,
for example:

```javascript
> console.dir(sharp.format);

{ jpeg: { id: 'jpeg',
    input: { file: true, buffer: true, stream: true },
    output: { file: true, buffer: true, stream: true } },
  png: { id: 'png',
    input: { file: true, buffer: true, stream: true },
    output: { file: true, buffer: true, stream: true } },
  webp: { id: 'webp',
    input: { file: true, buffer: true, stream: true },
    output: { file: true, buffer: true, stream: true } },
  tiff: { id: 'tiff',
    input: { file: true, buffer: true, stream: true },
    output: { file: true, buffer: false, stream: false } },
  magick: { id: 'magick',
    input: { file: true, buffer: true, stream: true },
    output: { file: false, buffer: false, stream: false } },
  raw: { id: 'raw',
    input: { file: false, buffer: false, stream: false },
    output: { file: false, buffer: true, stream: true } } }
```

#### queue

An EventEmitter that emits a `change` event when a task is either:

* queued, waiting for _libuv_ to provide a worker thread
* complete

```javascript
sharp.queue.on('change', function(queueLength) {
  console.log('Queue contains ' + queueLength + ' task(s)');
});
```

### Utilities

#### sharp.cache([memory], [items])

If `memory` or `items` are provided, set the limits of _libvips'_ operation cache.

* `memory` is the maximum memory in MB to use for this cache, with a default value of 100
* `items` is the maximum number of operations to cache, with a default value of 500

This method always returns cache statistics, useful for determining how much working memory is required for a particular task.

```javascript
var stats = sharp.cache(); // { current: 75, high: 99, memory: 100, items: 500 }
sharp.cache(200); // { current: 75, high: 99, memory: 200, items: 500 }
sharp.cache(50, 200); // { current: 49, high: 99, memory: 50, items: 200}
```

#### sharp.concurrency([threads])

`threads`, if provided, is the Number of threads _libvips'_ should create for processing each image. The default value is the number of CPU cores. A value of `0` will reset to this default.

This method always returns the current concurrency.

```javascript
var threads = sharp.concurrency(); // 4
sharp.concurrency(2); // 2
sharp.concurrency(0); // 4
```

The maximum number of images that can be processed in parallel is limited by libuv's `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` environment variable.

#### sharp.counters()

Provides access to internal task counters.

* `queue` is the number of tasks this module has queued waiting for _libuv_ to provide a worker thread from its pool.
* `process` is the number of resize tasks currently being processed.

```javascript
var counters = sharp.counters(); // { queue: 2, process: 4 }
```

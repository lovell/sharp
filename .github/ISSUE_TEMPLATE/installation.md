What is the output of running `npm install --verbose sharp`?

What is the output of running `npx envinfo --binaries --languages --system --utilities`?

Have you ensured the platform and version of Node.js used for `npm install` is the same as the platform and version of Node.js used at runtime?

If you're using `sudo npm install` have you tried with the `sudo npm install --unsafe-perm` flag?
